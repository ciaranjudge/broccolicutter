# Capture good ideas as they crop up üëç

## Python

- numpy format for docstrings
- Everything is inside either a function or a class
- "generate_" for generator functions that ```yield``` something
- "create_" for functions that create something and ```return``` it
- Singular for series/column names (e.g. "ppsn"), plural for df names (e.g. "ppsns")


## Other stuff

- Use emoji! :smile:
- Write a readme.txt for each project
- Frozen environments - where and when?

## Project creation script

- Add environment.yml from standard source
- Create environment from environment.yml and add to config so that used for new project
- This should be part of the cookiecutter script
- Can we automate creation of git repo? Locally and/or on TFS?
- Automated imports of some of the most common packages (e.g. pandas)?
- Set up jupytext
- Set up nice defaults for everything - especially Jupyter!
- Enable extension manager in Jupyter?
